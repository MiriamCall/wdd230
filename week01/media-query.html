        <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
        <p>
          19 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall
          of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the
          enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and
          becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and
          becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love,
          willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict
          upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.

        <h2>Alma 7:11-13</h2>
        <p>
          11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and
          temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled
          which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his
          people. 12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the
          bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their
          infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to
          the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his
          people according to their infirmities. 13 Now the Spirit knoweth all
          things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh
          that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot
          out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance;
          and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.
